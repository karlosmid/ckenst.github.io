Welcome to [TestingConferences.org](http://testingconferences.org), a simple list of Software Testing conferences and workshops published collaboratively with the testing community.

>[P]ublished collaboratively with the testing community.

This means we need **your help** to build and maintain this list.

**Contributing**

The easiest and most important way to do this is by maintaining the list of conferences and workshops. Look at the [current](/index.html) list of events and add to it or move an event that has passed to the [past](/past/) list.

The list of events is driven by files in the ```_data``` folder - if you have an update for those things, just change the ```current.yml``` and ```past.yml``` files and send a PR. The _order_ of the events listed in ```current.yml``` and ```past.yml``` dictates the _order_ displayed, please make sure to properly insert events.

**How do you add a conference or workshop?**

_Easy_. GitHub makes it easy for people to contribute by doing the following:

1. At the bottom of the page there is a link to [contribute](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/ckenst.github.io). Open it in a new Window.
2. Sign into GitHub
3. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo
4. Go into the `_data` folder
5. Make changes directly to `current.yml` or `past.yml`
6. Save your changes
7. Submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

_Then wait_. Your work is now done. Changes within your Pull Request will now be reviewed by a project member for accuracy and if it looks good we will merge it on your behalf.
