Yesterday for roughly 2.5 hours TestingConferences.org was down as we transferred our domain host away from GoDaddy and to a more reasonably priced (and flexible) Domain Registrar. Sorry for anyone who was impacted by the change but we believe going forward this was / is the right move.

We don't have many expenses outside of a time commitment to run this site and the domain name. The time commitment is part of the fun of contributing to open source and now the domain name is less expensive. =)
