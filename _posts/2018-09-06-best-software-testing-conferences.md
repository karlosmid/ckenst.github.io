We (should) all know attending conferences is the best way to keep our skills and knowledge up to date and a great chance to connect with peers in the larger testing community. Half of the year is gone but fear not, there are plenty of software testing conferences and workshops from around the world to attend.

Let's look at some of the **best** remaining software testing conferences and workshops of 2018:

## September

- **TestBash(es)** in **Germany, Manchester**.. on September 14th and 27th respectively.
- **KWSQA Targeting Quality 2018** on September 24-25.

## October

- **Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference (PNSQC) 2018** taking place on October 8-10, 2018.
    - PNSQC is one of the highest regarded conferences in the industry.
- **SeleniumConf (SeConf) Chicago 2018** on October 18-19, 2018.
    - I really wish I could make it this year but thankfully SeConf always records their talks.
- **TestBash Australia** on October 19th.

## November

- **TestBash San Francisco** on November 8-9th.
    - I'll be attending, will you? If so make sure to say hi!

- **Agile Testing Days (ATD) 2018** on November 12-16, 2018.
